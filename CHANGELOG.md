## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-04

First tagged release. mkhint manages slackrepo hint files: create/update hints,
nvchecker-driven update checks, phantom-dep stripping for -current, and a
listing/review workflow.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** the hint-version flag is now `-V` / `--set-version`. `-v` /
  `--version` now prints the tool's own version and exits.

### Added
- `-v` / `--version` prints `mkhint X.Y.Z`.
- The `--help` header shows the version.
- `-l` colors the newer version cell green and adds a `DelReq` column.
